# Building Logistic Regression from Scratch 

This project implements a Logistic Regression classifier using Python and the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn. The model is trained, evaluated, and tested using different metrics and visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Files in this repository:

- `LogisticRegression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the model code and visualizations.
- `LogisticRegression.html`: HTML export of the Jupyter notebook.
- `confusionMatrix.png`: Image of the confusion matrix.
- `logistic_regression.py`: Python file containing the Logistic Regression class.
- `loss.png`: Plot showing the loss curve during training.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abedini81/Logistic-Regression.git
